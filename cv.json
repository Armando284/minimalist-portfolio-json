Keycloak handles authentication, while my role involves feature enhancements, bug fixes, and UI/UX improvements. I also refactor code for better maintainability and optimize performance through image handling and search/sort algorithms. I boosted SEO by adding alt text, meta keywords, and semantic HTML, improving search visibility. Team turnover caused inconsistent code quality, which we mitigated with style guides, linters, and daily standups. These measures ensured consistency and streamlined issue resolution despite frequent personnel changes. A key challenge was Squidex’s lack of reference data sorting, requiring custom solutions to meet project needs. My contributions—from performance tuning to overcoming CMS limitations—strengthened the application’s scalability, usability, and long-term maintainability.",
